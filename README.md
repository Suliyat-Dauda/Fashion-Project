# Fashion-Project

## INTRODUCTION
This big data/business intelligence project is part of the fulfillment of my master's degree. 
It consists of 2 datasets anonymously sourced from a fashion data store and was used to provide actionable insight for an anonymous fashion store.
I used an extensive analytics framework encompassing big data analytics techniques. This involved writing HQL scripts in Hadoop to facilitate seamless data integration, utilizing Python for machine learning models, and leveraging Power BI for visualization. All of which facilitated the extraction of meaningful business intelligence insight within the fashion sector.

## AIMS AND OBJECTIVE
- To properly clean the dataset and perform EDA
- To flatten the p_attribute column from JSON to string columns
- To integrate the two datasets
- To identify customer behavior based on culture.
- To identify customerâ€™s preferences based on color
- To ascertain which occasion clothing significantly contributed to the revenue.
- To build machine learning model which predicts ratings and price

## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
- Crafting HQL/SQL scripts
- Understanding of Hadoop and the MapReduce ecosystem
- Python-based data cleansing, transformation, and preprocessing
- Utilizing Power BI for data visualization

## CONCLUSION 
This project focused on data integration and exploration within the fashion industry. The pre-processing and ML were done in Python while the integration process which merged the two datasets was achieved using Hive embedded in Hadoop, resulting in a unified table for analysis.
The Data Analysis unveiled insights into revenue influencers, customer preferences, and behaviors. Occasions and color impacts on revenue were investigated, with casual wear emerging as a major contributor. Cultural insights on saree fabrics were also revealed. Machine learning techniques like linear regression and Random Forest were employed to predict ratings and outcomes shows accuracies. 
Conclusively, this study provides an analysis into KPI and how big data can be utilized in the Fashion industry.
